## Key aim
I want to access a specific miro board that contanins a decesion trees with a start, questions, and final conclusions. The tree has one start note , multiple questions as diamond shapes containig the question, the connectors out from each question are labelled with the response. these lead to final conclusions. I want to generate a python frtienld file format, eg yaml that can contain such a decision tree. This will then be used to build a web page diplaying this tre and allowing a user to anwer the questions to get to a final conclusion. This web page is out for scope for now.
